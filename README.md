A oldschool runescape woodcutting script i wrote for a school project. I have used this script for eductational purposes only
and i trust you do the same. I had created an account for this experiment and have been banned within 12 hours. So use the script at 
your own risk. The script is run in the [DreamBot client.](https://dreambot.org)

## Why?

I made this application for a Java school project. I was given the task to create either a CRUD application, a Minecraft mod or anything
else that you could come up with.. I have played runescape myself and have always hated skilling for hours on end. So when this project 
was announced by our teacher i immediately wanted to work on a a script to make the life easier. However botting and scripting is against 
the Code of conduct and i never used this on my main account.


## How does it work?

**Chopping:**

As soon as the script starts running. It will look for the current closest tree object of the given tree type(edited in code).
As soon as the players inventory is full script will go for one of two options. It will either drop all logs or store them in the closest bank.
Down below is a GIF on what the chopping looks like.

**Banking:**

Eventually the players inventory will be full. As soon as that happends and the dropping setting is turned off, the player will walk to the
closest bank and store all items except for the axe there. Down below is a GIF on what that looks like
